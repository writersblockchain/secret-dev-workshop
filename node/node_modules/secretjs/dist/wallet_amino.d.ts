/**
 * AminoWallet is a wallet capable of signing on the legacy Amino encoding.
 * Amino encoding is still a must-use when signing with Ledger and thus still
 * supported in the chain, but is phased out slowly.
 *
 * In secret.js AminoWallet is mainly used for testing and should not be used
 * for anything else. The reason is that some Msg types don't support Amino
 * encoding anymore and thus won't work with this wallet (and Ledger).
 * Msgs that do support Amino encoding also must encode with Protobuf,
 * so if a Msg is working as intended with AminoWallet, it'll also work with {@link Wallet}.
 *
 * For reference, even txs that are signed using Amino, are sent to the chain
 * using Protobuf encoding, so inside the chain the tx is converted to Amino
 * in order to verify the signature.
